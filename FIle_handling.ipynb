    "# Step-by-Step Explanation of `build_folder_dict` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "This document provides a detailed breakdown of the `build_folder_dict` function, which creates a dictionary representing the structure of a folder, including its files and subfolders.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Importing `pathlib`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pathlib import Path\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `pathlib` is a Python module for handling file paths in a modern, object-oriented way.\n",
    "- `Path` is the main class used to represent file or folder paths.\n",
    "- It’s cross-platform (works on Windows, macOS, Linux) and is more convenient than older modules like `os.path`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Defining the Function\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def build_folder_dict(folder_path):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The function `build_folder_dict` takes a `folder_path` (a string, e.g., `\"my_folder\"`) as input.\n",
    "- Its purpose is to return a dictionary mapping folder names to their contents (files and subfolders).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Initializing the Dictionary\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "folder_dict = {}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `folder_dict` is the main dictionary that will store the folder structure.\n",
    "- Each key will be a folder’s relative path (as a string), and each value will be a dictionary with two keys:\n",
    "  - `'files'`: A list of file names in that folder.\n",
    "  - `'subfolders'`: A nested dictionary for subfolders.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Converting the Input Path\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "root_path = Path(folder_path)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Path(folder_path)` converts the input string (e.g., `\"my_folder\"`) into a `Path` object.\n",
    "- `root_path` represents the top-level folder to be scanned. It’s used to compute relative paths for all items.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Recursive Iteration with `rglob`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    for item in root_path.rglob('*'):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `root_path.rglob('*')` is a `pathlib` method that recursively iterates through all files and subfolders in `root_path`.\n",
    "- The `'*'` pattern matches all items (files and folders) at any depth.\n",
    "- Each `item` is a `Path` object representing a file or folder (e.g., `my_folder/file1.txt` or `my_folder/subfolder1`).\n",
    "- The `try` block catches errors like invalid folder paths or permission issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Getting the Parent Folder\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "parent = item.parent.relative_to(root_path) if item.parent != root_path else Path('.')\n",
    "parent_name = str(parent)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `item.parent` is the folder containing `item` (e.g., for `my_folder/subfolder1/file3.txt`, it’s `my_folder/subfolder1`).\n",
    "- `relative_to(root_path)` computes the parent’s path relative to the root (e.g., `subfolder1` for `my_folder/subfolder1`).\n",
    "- If `item.parent == root_path` (i.e., the item is directly in the root folder), we use `Path('.')` to represent the root folder as `\".\"`.\n",
    "- `parent_name = str(parent)` converts the path to a string (e.g., `\"subfolder1\"` or `\".\"`) for use as a dictionary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Initializing Folder Entry\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if parent_name not in folder_dict:\n",
    "    folder_dict[parent_name] = {'files': [], 'subfolders': {}}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the parent folder (e.g., `\"subfolder1\"`) isn’t in `folder_dict`, we create an entry.\n",
    "- The entry is a dictionary with:\n",
    "  - `'files'`: An empty list to store file names.\n",
    "  - `'subfolders'`: An empty dictionary to store subfolder information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Handling Files\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if item.is_file():\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        with item.open('r', encoding='utf-8') as f:\n",
    "            pass  # We don't need to read content, just verify access\n",
    "        folder_dict[parent_name]['files'].append(item.name)\n",
    "    except (UnicodeDecodeError, PermissionError, IOError):\n",
    "        continue  # Ignore files that can't be read\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `item.is_file()` checks if the current `item` is a file (not a folder).\n",
    "- We attempt to open the file in text mode (`'r'`) with `utf-8` encoding to verify it’s readable.\n",
    "- `item.open('r', encoding='utf-8')` tries to open the file.\n",
    "- `pass` means we don’t read the content; we just ensure it opens without errors.\n",
    "- If successful, we add the file’s name (`item.name`, e.g., `\"file1.txt\"`) to the `'files'` list of the parent folder.\n",
    "- If an error occurs (e.g., `UnicodeDecodeError` for binary files, `PermissionError` for locked files), we skip the file with `continue`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Handling Subfolders\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "elif item.is_dir():\n",
    "    subfolder = item.relative_to(root_path)\n",
    "    subfolder_name = str(subfolder)\n",
    "    if subfolder_name not in folder_dict:\n",
    "        folder_dict[subfolder_name] = {'files': [], 'subfolders': {}}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `item.is_dir()` checks if the current `item` is a folder.\n",
    "- `item.relative_to(root_path)` gets the folder’s path relative to the root (e.g., `\"subfolder1/subfolder2\"`).\n",
    "- `subfolder_name = str(subfolder)` converts it to a string for the dictionary key.\n",
    "- If the subfolder isn’t in `folder_dict`, we create an entry with empty `'files'` and `'subfolders'` fields.\n",
    "- This ensures every folder (even empty ones) is represented in the dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Error Handling for the Folder\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "except Exception as e:\n",
    "    print(f\"Error accessing folder {folder_path}: {e}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- If there’s a problem accessing the folder (e.g., it doesn’t exist or lacks permissions), we print an error and continue.\n",
    "- The function will still return `folder_dict` (possibly empty if no items were processed).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. Returning the Result\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "return folder_dict\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The function returns `folder_dict`, which contains the full folder structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12. Example Usage and Pretty Printing\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "folder_path = \"path/to/your/folder\"\n",
    "result = build_folder_dict(folder_path)\n",
    "import json\n",
    "print(json.dumps(result, indent=2))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- `folder_path` is the path to the folder you want to scan (replace with your actual path).\n",
    "- `build_folder_dict(folder_path)` runs the function and returns the dictionary.\n",
    "- `json.dumps(result, indent=2)` prints the dictionary in a readable, indented format.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example Folder Structure and Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose your folder is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_folder/\n",
    "├── file1.txt\n",
    "├── file2.bin (unreadable)\n",
    "├── subfolder1/\n",
    "│   ├── file3.txt\n",
    "│   ├── subfolder2/\n",
    "│   │   ├── file4.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Running the code produces a dictionary like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \".\": {\n",
    "    \"files\": [\"file1.txt\"],\n",

    "        }\n",
    "      }\n",
    "    }\n",

    "    \"files\": [\"file4.txt\"],\n",
    "    \"subfolders\": {}\n",
    "  }\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why `pathlib`?** It simplifies path handling (no `os.path.join` needed) and is more readable. `rglob` makes recursion easy.\n",
    "- **Dictionary Structure:** Each folder is a key, with a value containing `'files'` (list of readable files) and `'subfolders'` (nested dictionary).\n",
    "- **Skipping Unreadable Files:** The `try-except` block ensures binary files, locked files, or other inaccessible files are ignored.\n",
    "- **Relative Paths:** Using `relative_to` keeps folder names clean (e.g., `\"subfolder1\"` instead of full paths).\n",
    "- **Empty Folders:** They’re included with empty `'files'` and `'subfolders'` fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Potential Tweaks\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Filter Extensions:** Add `if item.suffix == '.txt'` in the `is_file()` block to only include specific file types.\n",
    "- **Include Binary Files:** Change `open('r', encoding='utf-8')` to `open('rb')` to include all files.\n",
    "- **Simplify Structure:** If you don’t need the `'subfolders'` nesting, the code can be modified to flatten it.\n",
